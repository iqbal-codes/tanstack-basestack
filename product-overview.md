## Problems Pabriq Solves

1. **Custom order chaos** — MTO orders with custom specs, design files, quantities, and pricing need structured intake instead of WhatsApp threads and email
2. **Production visibility** — Orders must be trackable through configurable stages so the team knows what to work on and when
3. **Design/artwork approval** — Customers submit custom designs or artwork; admins review, request revisions, and approve before production starts
4. **Payment for custom work** — Down payments (DP) and full invoicing for custom orders, with gateway integration for collections
5. **Asset reuse** — Reusable materials, screens, molds, templates, and patterns tied to customers and products reduce setup costs on repeat orders
6. **Financial oversight** — Income from invoices tracked alongside expenses (materials, labor, overhead) for true job costing
7. **Customer self-service** — Customers can submit specs, upload designs, track status, and pay invoices without contacting staff

## Key User Journeys

### Journey 1: Customer Places Custom Order

1. Admin creates **draft order** with line items (custom product, quantity, base specs)
2. System generates secure token and sends link to customer
3. Customer opens portal, fills detailed specs, uploads design/artwork files, selects courier
4. Customer submits draft → status becomes `pending`
5. Admin reviews, approves with promised delivery date and payment terms (partial or full)
6. System creates down payment invoice and **production tasks** for each line item
7. Customer pays via bank transfer or payment gateway
8. Admin marks invoice paid → order moves to `production`
9. Tasks flow through workflow stages; operator advances cards
10. Admin marks fulfilled → final invoice generated with shipping cost
11. Customer pays final invoice; admin completes order

### Journey 2: Production Stage Progression

1. Order approval spawns tasks in first workflow stage
2. Operator views kanban board with all active tasks
3. Operator moves task to next stage (e.g., printing → cutting → finishing)
4. If stage has approval gate, task enters `pending` state
5. Admin or supervisor approves or rejects
6. Task reaches final stage, operator marks done
7. Tasks auto-archived if order cancelled

### Journey 3: Design Approval Loop

1. Order with custom artwork appears in design review queue
2. Admin or operator uploads design files to task attachments
3. Admin approves artwork (order continues to production) or requests revision with notes
4. On revision request, customer receives notification and resubmits corrected files
5. Loop continues until artwork is approved

## Gaps & Opportunities (Roadmap)

### High Priority

- [ ] **Inventory/Stock Management** — no raw material or consumable tracking; assets are reusable but no stock depletion
- [ ] **Bill of Materials** — no cost breakdown per product; pricing tiers exist but no actual cost structure or job costing
- [ ] **Production Scheduling / Gantt** — kanban is stage-based, no calendar view or capacity planning per operator/machine
- [ ] **Customer Portal Login** — magic link tokens work but no persistent customer accounts with order history
- [ ] **Automated Reminders** — no scheduled notifications for overdue invoices or approaching delivery dates
- [ ] **Role Permissions Granularity** — admin vs operator permissions are coarse; field-level or action-level RBAC not implemented

### Medium Priority

- [ ] **Mobile App / PWA** — no mobile companion app for operators on the shop floor
- [ ] **Batch Work Order Print** — work order batch printing not implemented
- [ ] **Webhook for Telegram** — outbound notifications exist, no inbound handling from Telegram
- [ ] **Audit Log / Activity Feed** — no unified activity log across all resources
- [ ] **Duplicate Order** — no quick "order again" with same specs for returning customers
- [ ] **Tax / Invoice Numbering** — no tax ID field or custom invoice number prefix/format
- [ ] **Multi-currency** — platform assumes single currency
- [ ] **Reporting / BI** — basic dashboard stats, no exportable or configurable reports

### Lower Priority

- [ ] **White-label / Custom Domain** — no per-tenant domain or full branding customization beyond logo
- [ ] **API Keys for Customers** — no public API for programmatic order submission from customer systems
- [ ] **Product Bundle / Kit** — no grouping of multiple products into a single SKU
- [ ] **Recurring Orders / Subscriptions** — no subscription or recurring order model for retainer clients
- [ ] **Credit Limit Management** — credit flag exists on customer but no limit enforcement
- [ ] **Additional Notification Channels** — Telegram only; no Slack, Discord, or email integration
- [ ] **Localization beyond Indonesian** — next-intl present but single-locale content
